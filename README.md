Etch a Sketch Project from Odin Project.

Planning on trying to complete this project even thought my HTML, CSS is rusty and haven't finished fully learning JS.

Lets see how this goes...

Description:
Perfect settings with buttons then click and drag your mouse across the screen to see a trail left over.

commit 1:
Change Color Button which allows for a random color to be generated and used as each cell's background.
Change Grid Size Button allowing customizable gride size from 1-100 (inclusive).
Reset Background Button which resets background to white.
